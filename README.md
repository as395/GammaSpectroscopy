## Coding - To Do
1. ~~Complete peak efficiency input from TRIUMF~~

2. ~~Make printing of normalized inputs clearer~~

3. ~~Fix labels/energy levels (keV)~~

4. ~~Find resource for Eu-152 decay and summing~~ 

4a. _Put data in text file_

4b. _Test in code and compare_

5. Find out how best to report summing error (percentage?)

## Writing/Research - To Do
1. Print Gilmore chapter (so I can finish the example from home)

2. ~~Describe why HPGe detectors are used~~ 

2a. _Describe via Inorganic Chemistry/advanced Physics_ 

3. Keep writing!!
